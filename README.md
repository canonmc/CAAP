# C.A.A.P.
Competitor Awareness Application

The purpose of this project is to track publicly available information on competitor companies, and thus enable Autozone to derive financial insights.

## Installation
- Install Python from [this page](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Python Downloads")
- Pip should be installed automatically with Python, but if not you can run the listed function in the command prompt to retrieve it.
> python -m ensurepip --upgrade
- Once this is done, in the command prompt navigate into the directory containing the project (C:/.../CAAP) and type the following command:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

After this completes, all that is needed is to type main.py into the command prompt (from within the CAAP folder), or by double-clicking main.py from the file explorer.
